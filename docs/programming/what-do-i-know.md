# What do I know about Programming? 

Not nearly enough. I am a programmer at heart. Full Stack Developer. But what does that really mean? Depends on who you ask. If you ask me, it means that I know how to configure, set up, maintain a server, and components that allow said server to host websites for consumption. I know how to harden it, ensure data hygiene, make sure that the files are accessible, and that everything performs at it's peak. 

If you ask a programmer these days, Full Stack means something very different. It means even more different things if that person is a JAMStack developer. Not to knock on them, I know a bunch of them, and have worked closely with a bunch as well. Some of the smartest people I know are JAMStack devs, and so are some of the worst adaptable. 

I learned on PHP, HTML, CSS, JavaScript and jQuery. Yeah. I aged myself. Oh well. 

This section will be highlighting cool(to me at least) things I have found as I stumble across the internet, expanding my knowledge of Programming and also now Vibe Coding. Join me on my journey, and learn some things out for yourself as well!
