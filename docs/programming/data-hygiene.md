# Data Hygiene! Does your code smell? 

Data Hygiene! Something to think about, although not something that a lot of larger organizations think about when first building out a new tool, application, or hub. Data Hygiene is important for the GIANTS OF INDUSTRY! as well as the everyday Aaditya's, Tim's, and Chuk's that might want to build something out, and ensure that their product is easily maintained and used in the future.
