# How-to's Intro

Here, I will outline different How-To's that I've written, or mashed together from ones I've found along the way. Please keep in mind the dates of them being published, as things do update regularly in the tech world. 

## Getting Started

To use any of the How-To's, I am operating under the assumption that you have some base knowledge of technology stacks, and how they work/operate with one another. There will be pre-requisites listed for each tutorial as well. 

The best place to start is at the beginning! Being a forever student, I hope me sharing the things I find along the way help you out!
