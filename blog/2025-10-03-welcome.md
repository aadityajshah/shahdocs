Hello and welcome to my blog! I have recently re-vamped and updated my website, and this is my new blog.

This blog is written and maintained through Docusaurus, so shout out to the Docusaurus team! 

Real quick about me, the auther, Aaditya Shah. I live in the 'burbs outside of Raleigh, NC. Growing up in the DMV (DC Maryland Virginia for the un-initiated), I am a city person at heart. That being said, I do love living
here for with my family (Wife, daughter, son and two miniature schnauzers). I am a nerd/geek/techie whatever you want to label me as, I really don't care. I love learning new technologies, and getting to play around with them. For my 9-5, I work in Cybersecurity, and I love tinkering with the tools and offerings we have. 

I grew up in the restaurant industry, and I have a deep deep love and appreciation for food. You might see some recipes here. You might see some food reviews. I don't really know. 

Welcome to my space of the World Wide Web! I hope you enjoy your visit!
